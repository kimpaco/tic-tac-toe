# tic-tac-toe

Description:
A simple tic-tac-toe game using React

Future improvements:
-I'd like to add a disable feature to prevent any further inputs after a winner has been decided. Right now the game is set to validate the status of the game after each player move, and upon finding a match to one of the 8 winning outcomes, it displays a message announcing the winner. But the game can still take inputs and change the winner in accordance with the one who just made the last move.
